1. To read a number and to check and display whether it is greater than 100 or not.
2. To convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.
3. To calculate multiplication and division of two numbers.
4. To read marks for 3 subjects and to calculate and display the percent obtained. Also display the correct position based on the following criteria;

5. To read a character and count the number of 'b' characters (for boy) and 'g' characters (for girl). The read process should repeat until the character 'x' is entered. *(Hint: use do-while loop)*

**Instructions:**

1. Make a separate HTML file for each problem above and name them like *question_1.html*, *question_2.html*, and so on.
2. Create a single file for all your JavaScript code and name it as *scripts.js*. Use reference to this file from all HTML files.
3. Try using only the materials that we covered in the class so far. Avoid using any complex JavaScript functions and objects.
4. Problem #1 has already been done in the class. Make necessary changes so that all the JavaScript code goes to *scripts.js* file.
